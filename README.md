# Google Apps for Desktop
A simple Desktop client for Mac OS-X built using [Nativfier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier "Nativfier") and [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron "Electron").


# Why did I do it?
I am a heavy Google Apps user but I personally don't like being limited to the clients in my browser. It becomes a bit harder to shift through things when you are working on other tasks with other tabs being open. 


# What is it?
This is a project that derived from [Nativfier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier "Nativfier"), which was built in [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron "Electron"). All the main Google browser apps are bundled in an Electron web-view with additional support for native OS-X notifications and reminders.


# How to build
Build using instructions on [Nativfier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier "Nativfier")


# How to run
1) Install using the .mpkg provided. It will give you optional installs for each app.
2) Enjoy
